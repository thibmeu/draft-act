1.  Introduction

   [ARCHITECTURE] describes the Privacy Pass architecture, and
   [ISSUANCE] and [AUTHSCHEME] describe the issuance and redemption
   protocols for basic Privacy Pass tokens, i.e., those computed using
   blind RSA signatures as specified in Section 6 of [ISSUANCE] or
   verifiable oblivious pseudorandom functions as specified in Section 5
   of [ISSUANCE].  Further, the [ARC] scheme and its associated
   integration in [ARCHITECTURE] ([ARC_PP]) extend these approaches to
   multi-use tokens.

   The Anonymous Credit Tokens (ACT) protocol, as specified in [ACT],
   offers a differentiated approach to rate limiting from [ARC].  In
   particular, a credential initially holding N credits, along with its
   subsequent refunded credentials, can be presented up to N times.
   When a client spends a certain number of credits from a credential,
   that credential is invalidated and the client receives a new
   credential with the remaining balance.

   This document specifies the issuance and redemption protocols for
   ACT.  Section 2 describes motivation for this new type of token,
   Section 4 presents an overview of the protocols, and the remainder of
   the document specifies the protocols themselves.

2.  Motivation

   To demonstrate how ACT is useful, one can use a similar example to
   the one presented in Section 2 of [ARC_PP]: a client that wishes to
   keep its IP address private while accessing a service.  [ARC_PP]
   offers the origin to limit the number of requests a client can make
   to N.  This is enforced by each origin getting its own presentation
   context, and limiting the number of presentations per context to N.
   This means that, from a single credential, a client can produce N
   presentations and access the system N times, unlinkably.  These
   presentations can be generated in parallel.

   On the other hand, consider a credential initially holding N credits.
   A client redeeming all N credits individually has to spend 1, receive
   a refunded credential with N-1 credits, spend 1 from that credential,
   receive a refunded credential with N-2 credits, and so on.  Because
   the client cannot spend from a credential until they receive the
   refunded credential from their previous spend, a single live session
   is enforced per initial credential.  This provides concurrency
   control.  A client is also able to spend more than 1 credit at once,
   allowing for more efficient redemption of multiple credits.  Finally,
   as each new presentation requires obtaining a refunded credential
   from the previous spend, the origin gains the ability to invalidate a
   session by declining to issue a refunded credential.  This creates
   the ability to shed harmful future traffic or redirect it in a
   favorable way.

   One such use case for this is a privacy proxy, another is privately
   accessing web APIs like the artificial intelligence models, and
   finally zero trust networks which act as forward proxies for their
   user traffic.

   Therefore, ACT provides the following properties:

   1.  Concurrency control: Preventing multiple simultaneous uses of the
       same credential, mitigating abuse from credential sharing or
       replay.

   2.  Dynamic Revocation: Enabling immediate invalidation of
       credentials in response to origin policy, without waiting for
       credential expiry.

   3.  Per-Session Rate Limiting: Enforcing access policies that adapt
       to user, device, or risk context, rather than static per-
       credential limits.  This creates incentives for platforms to
       deploy such methods.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms Origin, Client, Issuer, and Token as
   defined in Section 2 of [ARCHITECTURE].  Moreover, the following
   additional terms are used throughout this document.

   *  Issuer Public Key: The public key (from a private-public key pair)
      used by the Issuer for issuing and verifying Tokens.

   *  Issuer Private Key: The private key (from a private-public key
      pair) used by the Issuer for issuing and verifying Tokens.

   OPEN ISSUE: Consider taking them from [ACT]

   Unless otherwise specified, this document encodes protocol messages
   in TLS notation from Section 3 of [TLS13].  Moreover, all constants
   are in network byte order.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The issuance and redemption protocols defined in this document are
   built on the Anonymous Credit Tokens (ACT) protocol.  ACT credentials
   can be thought of as single use credentials, similar to the RSA Blind
   Signatures protocol.  However, by another viewpoint, they might be
   thought of as stateful, multi-use credentials.

   With ACT, Clients receive TokenChallenge inputs from the redemption
   protocol ([AUTHSCHEME], Section 2.1).  If they have a valid ACT
   credential for the designated Issuer, Clients can use the
   TokenChallenge to produce a single token for presentation.
   Otherwise, Clients invoke the issuance protocol to obtain an ACT
   credential.  This interaction is shown below.

                                         +--------------------------.
   +--------+          +----------+      |  +--------+   +--------+  |
   | Client |          | Attester |      |  | Issuer |   | Origin |  |
   +---+----+          +-----+----+      |  +----+---+   +---+----+  |
       |                     |            `------|-----------|------'
       |                     |                   |           |
       +--------------------- Request ---------------------->|
       |<---------------- TokenChallenge --------------------+
       |                     |                   |           |
       |<=== Attestation ===>|                   |           |
       +----------- CredentialRequest ---------->|           |
       |<---------- CredentialResponse ----------+           |
       |                     |                   |           |
       +----------- Request + Token ------------------------>|
       |<---------- Response + TokenRefund ------------------+
       |                     |                   |           |

                 Figure 1: Issuance and Redemption Overview

   Similar to the core Privacy Pass protocols, the TokenChallenge can be
   interactive or non-interactive, and per-origin or cross-origin.

   ACT is only compatible with deployment models where the Issuer and
   Origin are operated by the same entity (see Section 4 of
   [ARCHITECTURE]), as tokens produced from a credential are not
   publicly verifiable.  The details of attestation are outside the
   scope of the issuance protocol; see Section 4 of [ARCHITECTURE] for
   information about how attestation can be implemented in each of the
   relevant deployment models.

   The issuance and redemption protocols in this document are built on
   [ACT].

5.  Client State Management

5.1.  Credential Lifecycle and Distributed Transactions

   ACT credentials follow a distributed transaction model where each
   spend operation creates a two-phase interaction between the client
   and the origin:

   1.  *Spend Phase*: The client commits to spending a credential by
       generating a spend proof containing a nullifier.  At this point,
       the credential MUST be considered invalid and cannot be reused.

   2.  *Refund Phase*: The origin verifies the spend proof and, if
       valid, returns a refund that allows the client to construct a new
       credential with the remaining balance.

   This two-phase model is critical for ACT's concurrency control
   properties.  Because a credential becomes invalid immediately upon
   spend (before the refund is received), a client cannot perform
   multiple concurrent spend operations with the same credential.  This
   enforces a strict serialization of operations per credential chain.

5.2.  Client State Transitions

   A client managing an ACT credential progresses through the following
   states:

      +----------+
      |  Initial |  (Credential with N credits)
      +----+-----+
           |
           | ProveSpend(credential, cost)
           v
      +----------+
      |   Spent  |  (Waiting for refund, credential invalid)
      +----+-----+
           |
           | ConstructRefundToken(refund)
           v
      +----------+
      | Refunded |  (New credential with N-cost credits)
      +----------+

   State transitions:

   *  *Initial*: Client holds a valid credential with N credits (N > 0).
      The credential can be spent.

   *  *Spent*: Client has generated a spend proof and sent it to the
      origin.  The original credential is now invalid and MUST NOT be
      used again.  The client is blocked waiting for a refund response.

   *  *Refunded*: Client has received a valid refund and constructed a
      new credential with the remaining balance.  If the new balance is
      greater than 0, the client returns to the Initial state with the
      new credential.  If the balance is 0, the credential is exhausted.

   The transition from Spent to Refunded may fail if the origin does not
   provide a valid refund.  Error handling for this case is described in
   Section 5.5.

5.3.  Concurrency Control Through Blocking

   The key insight enabling ACT's concurrency control is that each
   credential instance can only be in one state at a time.  When a
   client calls ProveSpend, it must immediately transition the
   credential to the Spent state, making it unavailable for any other
   operations.  The client cannot perform another spend until it
   receives a refund and transitions to the Refunded state with a new
   credential instance.

   This blocking behavior prevents credential sharing and concurrent
   usage:

   *  If a malicious party attempts to copy a credential and use it
      elsewhere, only one spend operation can succeed (whichever reaches
      the origin first).  The second spend will be rejected as a double-
      spend when the origin checks the nullifier.

   *  Even if a single client attempts to perform concurrent spends with
      the same credential, the first spend invalidates the credential,
      preventing the second.

   The origin can enforce session behavior by declining to issue a
   refund, effectively terminating the credential chain and preventing
   further operations.

5.4.  Multiple Credential Management

   Clients MAY maintain multiple independent credential chains
   simultaneously.  This is useful when credentials are bound to
   different contexts via the credential_context field (Section 7).

   Example: A client might hold:

   *  Credential A: Bound to issuer1.example, origin1.example,
      credential_context = "session-2024-01", with 100 credits

   *  Credential B: Bound to issuer1.example, origin2.example,
      credential_context = "session-2024-01", with 50 credits

   *  Credential C: Bound to issuer1.example, origin1.example,
      credential_context = "session-2024-02", with 75 credits

   Each credential chain operates independently with its own state
   machine.  A spend operation on Credential A does not affect
   Credentials B or C.  The client can perform spend operations on
   different credentials concurrently, but each individual credential
   chain is strictly serialized through the spend-refund cycle.

   When the client receives a TokenChallenge, it determines which
   credential to use based on the challenge's issuer_name, origin_info,
   and credential_context fields.  If no matching credential exists or
   all matching credentials are in the Spent state (awaiting refund),
   the client SHOULD either wait for a refund or request a new
   credential through the issuance protocol.

5.5.  Error Handling

5.5.1.  Delayed or Missing Refunds

   After a client sends a spend proof to the origin, the client must
   wait for the corresponding refund before it can continue using the
   credential chain.  The spent credential instance is immediately
   invalid and MUST NOT be reused.

   Origins MAY retain spend proof state and serve delayed refund
   requests after service interruptions or failures.  This allows
   credential chains to resume even if the initial refund response was
   not delivered due to network issues or temporary service outages.

   However, origins MAY also implement a timeout after which they delete
   stored refund state.  If a client's refund request arrives after this
   timeout, the origin will be unable to provide the refund, effectively
   terminating that credential chain.  Clients in this situation will
   need to request a new credential through the issuance protocol
   (Section 8) to continue accessing the origin.

6.  Configuration

   ACT Issuers are configured with key material used for issuance and
   credential verification.  Concretely, Issuers run the KeyGen function
   from [ACT] to produce a private and public key, denoted skI and pkI,
   respectively.

   skI, pkI = KeyGen()

   The Issuer Public Key ID, denoted issuer_key_id, is computed as the
   SHA-256 hash of the Issuer Public Key, i.e., issuer_key_id = SHA-
   256(pkI_serialized), where pkI_serialized is the serialized version
   of pkI as described in Section 4.1 of [ACT].

   OPEN ISSUE: Coordinate with [ACT] specification authors on the
   serialization format (CBOR vs TLS presentation language) to ensure
   consistency.

6.1.  Request Context Extension

   This Privacy Pass integration binds credentials to application-
   specific contexts using a request_context parameter.  This approach
   is inspired by the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credentials (ARC) protocol
   [ARC_PP], which threads a similar context parameter through its
   cryptographic operations for domain separation.

   IMPORTANT: The current CFRG ACT specification [ACT] does not include
   request_context parameters in its cryptographic functions.  To
   support the Privacy Pass integration described in this document, the
   ACT specification would need to be extended with the following
   changes:

   1.  *IssueRequest*: No changes needed - the client generates a
       blinded commitment without knowledge of the final context
       binding.

   2.  *IssueResponse*: Add request_context as an input parameter
       alongside the credit amount c.  The issuer determines the
       appropriate context based on its policy (e.g., derived from
       TokenChallenge fields) and binds the credential to this context.
       The function would hash the context into a scalar and include it
       in the credential signature, similar to how ARC hashes
       requestContext into m2.

   3.  *VerifyAndRefund*: Add request_context as an input parameter to
       verify that the spend proof is bound to the correct application
       context.  The issuer reconstructs the context from the
       TokenChallenge and uses it during verification.

   4.  *Credential Structure*: The Anonymous Credit Token structure
       would be extended to include the context-bound component within
       the BBS signature, analogous to how ARC credentials include m2
       for presentation context binding.

   The key insight is that request_context is determined by the issuer
   (like the credit amount), not by the client.  The issuer sets the
   context during IssueResponse based on the TokenChallenge
   requirements, and both parties reconstruct it from TokenChallenge
   fields during spending.

   Until these extensions are incorporated into the CFRG ACT
   specification, the function calls in this document should be
   understood as describing the intended behavior with request_context
   support.  Implementations SHOULD coordinate with the CFRG ACT
   specification authors to ensure compatibility.

   For reference on how request context threading works in practice, see
   Section 3 of [ARC_PP], which demonstrates the pattern of binding
   credentials to application-specific contexts through cryptographic
   commitments.

7.  Token Challenge Requirements

   The ACT protocol uses a modified TokenChallenge structure from the
   one specified in [AUTHSCHEME].  In particular, the updated
   TokenChallenge structure is as follows:

   struct {
       uint16_t token_type = 0xE5AD; /* Type ACT(Ristretto255) */
       opaque issuer_name<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque redemption_context<0..32>;
       opaque origin_info<0..2^16-1>;
       opaque credential_context<0..32>;
   } TokenChallenge;

   OPEN ISSUE: This token type value (0xE5AD) was chosen arbitrarily and
   may be too close to the ARC token type.  This should be coordinated
   with IANA registry assignments.

   With the exception of credential_context, all fields are exactly as
   specified in Section 2.1.1 of [AUTHSCHEME].  The credential_context
   field is defined as follows:

   *  "credential_context" is a field that is either 0 or 32 bytes,
      prefixed with a single octet indicating the length (either 0 or
      32).  If the value is non-empty, it is a 32-byte value generated
      by the origin that allows the origin to require that clients fetch
      credentials bound to a specific context.  Challenges with
      credential_context values of invalid lengths MUST be rejected.

   Similar to the redemption_context field, the credential_context is
   used to bind information to the credential.  This might be useful,
   for example, to enforce some expiration on the credential.  Origins
   might do this by constructing credential_context as F(current time
   window), where F is a pseudorandom function.  Semantically, this is
   equivalent to the Origin asking the Client for a token from a
   credential that is bound to "current time window."

   OPEN ISSUE: give more guidance about how to construct
   credential_context and redemption_context depending on the
   application's needs.

   In addition to this updated TokenChallenge, the HTTP authentication
   challenge also SHOULD contain the following additional attribute:

   *  "cost", which contains a JSON number indicating the amount of
      credits to spend out of the ACT credential.

   Implementation-specific steps: the client should store the Origin-
   provided input tokenChallenge so that when they receive a new
   tokenChallenge value, they can check if it has changed and which
   fields are different.  This will inform the client's behavior - for
   example, if credential_context is being used to enforce an expiration
   on the credential, then if the credential_context has changed, this
   can prompt the client to request a new credential.

8.  Credential Issuance Protocol

   Issuers provide an Issuer Private and Public Key, denoted skI and pkI
   respectively, used to produce credentials as input to the protocol.
   See Section 6 for how these keys are generated.

   Clients provide the following as input to the issuance protocol:

   *  Issuer Request URL: A URL identifying the location to which
      issuance requests are sent.  This can be a URL derived from the
      "issuer-request-uri" value in the Issuer's directory resource, or
      it can be another Client-configured URL.  The value of this
      parameter depends on the Client configuration and deployment
      model.  For example, in the 'Joint Origin and Issuer' deployment
      model, the Issuer Request URL might correspond to the Client's
      configured Attester, and the Attester is configured to relay
      requests to the Issuer.

   *  Issuer name: An identifier for the Issuer.  This is typically a
      host name that can be used to construct HTTP requests to the
      Issuer.

   *  Issuer Public Key: pkI, with a key identifier token_key_id
      computed as described in Section 6.

   Given this configuration and these inputs, the two messages exchanged
   in this protocol to produce a credential are described below.

8.1.  Client-to-Issuer Request

   Given Origin-provided input tokenChallenge and the Issuer Public Key
   ID issuer_key_id, the Client first creates a credential request
   message using the IssueRequest function from [ACT] as follows:

   (clientSecrets, request) = IssueRequest()

   The Client then creates a TokenRequest structure as follows:

   struct {
     uint16_t token_type = 0xE5AD; /* Type ACT(Ristretto255) */
     uint8_t truncated_issuer_key_id;
     uint8_t encoded_request[Nrequest];
   } TokenRequest;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "token_type" is a 2-octet integer.

   *  "truncated_issuer_key_id" is the least significant byte of the
      issuer_key_id (Section 6) in network byte order (in other words,
      the last 8 bits of issuer_key_id).  This value is truncated so
      that Issuers cannot use issuer_key_id as a way of uniquely
      identifying Clients; see Section 10 and referenced information for
      more details.

   *  "encoded_request" is the Nrequest-octet request, computed as the
      serialization of the request value as defined in Section 4.1.1 of
      [ACT].

   The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer
   Request URL, with the TokenRequest as the content.  The media type
   for this request is "application/private-credential-request".  An
   example request for the Issuer Request URL
   "https://issuer.example.net/request" is shown below.

   POST /request HTTP/1.1
   Host: issuer.example.net
   Accept: application/private-credential-response
   Content-Type: application/private-credential-request
   Content-Length: <Length of TokenRequest>

   <Bytes containing the TokenRequest>

8.2.  Issuer-to-Client Response

   Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following
   conditions:

   *  The TokenRequest contains a supported token_type equal to value
      0xE5AD.

   *  The TokenRequest.truncated_token_key_id corresponds to the
      truncated key ID of an Issuer Public Key, with corresponding
      secret key skI, owned by the Issuer.

   *  The TokenRequest.encoded_request is of the correct size
      (Nrequest).

   If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP
   422 (Unprocessable Content) error to the client.

   If these conditions are met, the Issuer then tries to deserialize
   TokenRequest.encoded_request according to Section 4.1.1 of [ACT],
   yielding request.  If this fails, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP 422
   (Unprocessable Content) error to the client.  Otherwise, if the
   Issuer is willing to produce a credential for the Client, the Issuer
   determines both the number of initial credits and the request_context
   based on its policy (e.g., based on attestation results, payment
   verification, or TokenChallenge requirements).  The request_context
   binds the credential to the specific application context:

request_context = concat(tokenChallenge.issuer_name,
  tokenChallenge.origin_info,
  tokenChallenge.credential_context,
  issuer_key_id)
response = IssueResponse(skI, request, initial_credits, request_context)

   The Issuer then creates a TokenResponse structured as follows:

   struct {
      uint8_t encoded_response[Nresponse];
   } TokenResponse;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "encoded_response" is the Nresponse-octet encoded issuance
      response message, computed as the serialization of response as
      specified in Section 4.1.2 of [ACT].

   The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose
   content consists of TokenResponse, with the content type set as
   "application/private-credential-response".

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/private-credential-response
   Content-Length: <Length of TokenResponse>

   <Bytes containing the TokenResponse>

8.3.  Credential Finalization

   Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful,
   deserializes the content values TokenResponse.encoded_response
   according to Section 4.1.2 of [ACT] yielding response.  If
   deserialization fails, the Client aborts the protocol.  Otherwise,
   the Client processes the response as follows:

   credential = VerifyIssuance(pkI, request, response, clientSecrets)

   The Client then saves the credential structure, associated with the
   given Issuer Name, to use when producing Token values in response to
   future token challenges.

9.  Token Redemption Protocol

   The token redemption protocol takes as input TokenChallenge and cost
   values from [AUTHSCHEME], Section 2.1; the cost is sent as an
   additional attribute within the HTTP challenge as described in
   Section 7.  Clients use credentials from the issuance protocol in
   producing tokens bound to the TokenChallenge.  The process for
   producing a token in this way, as well as verifying a resulting
   token, is described in the following sections.

9.1.  Token Creation

   Given a TokenChallenge value as input, denoted challenge, a cost,
   denoted cost, and a previously obtained credential that is valid for
   the Issuer identifier in the challenge, denoted credential,
   containing at least cost credits, Clients compute a spend request as
   follows:

   spend_proof, state = ProveSpend(credential, cost)

   Each credential instance MUST only ever be used for a single spend
   request.  When the client receives the refunded credential from the
   server, the client uses that new credential instance for the next
   spend.  If the same credential instance is used more than once, the
   privacy assumptions of ACT are violated by presenting the same
   nullifier twice.

   The resulting Token value is then constructed as follows:

   struct {
       uint16_t token_type = 0xE5AD; /* Type ACT(Ristretto255) */
       uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
       uint8_t issuer_key_id[Nid];
       uint8_t encoded_spend_proof[Nspend_proof];
   } Token;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, in network byte order, equal to
      0xE5AD.

   *  "challenge_digest" is a 32-octet value containing the hash of the
      original TokenChallenge, SHA-256(TokenChallenge).

   *  "issuer_key_id" is a Nid-octet identifier for the Issuer Public
      Key, computed as defined in Section 6.

   *  "encoded_spend_proof" is a Nspend_proof-octet encoded spend proof,
      set to the serialized spend_proof value as specified in
      Section 4.1.3 of [ACT].  The spend proof contains the nullifier
      (field 1) and spend amount (field 2), among other cryptographic
      values.

9.2.  Token Refund

   Upon receiving a Token from the Client, the Origin deserializes the
   spend_proof according to Section 4.1.3 of [ACT], yielding a
   SpendProofMsg structure.  The Origin then extracts the relevant
   fields from the spend proof:

   // Extract fields from SpendProofMsg (see Section 4.1.3 of ACT)
   nullifier = spend_proof.k      // Field 1: nullifier (32 bytes)
   spend_amount = spend_proof.s   // Field 2: spend amount (32 bytes)

   The Origin SHOULD verify that the spend_amount matches the requested
   cost from TokenChallenge to ensure the client is spending the
   expected amount.

   To verify the Token and issue a refund, the Origin constructs the
   request_context and invokes VerifyAndRefund:

   request_context = concat(tokenChallenge.issuer_name,
     tokenChallenge.origin_info,
     tokenChallenge.credential_context,
     issuer_key_id)
   refund = VerifyAndRefund(skI, request_context, spend_proof)

   This function returns the refund serialized according to
   Section 4.1.4 of [ACT] if the spend proof is valid, and nil
   otherwise.

   As mentioned in Section 2.2.2 of [AUTHSCHEME], Origins SHOULD
   implement some form of double-spend prevention that prevents a token
   with the same nonce from being redeemed twice.  With ACT, the Origin
   SHOULD check that the nullifier has not previously been seen before
   calling VerifyAndRefund.  It then stores the nullifier for use in
   future double-spending checks.  To reduce the overhead of performing
   double spend checks, the Origin MAY store and look up the nullifiers
   corresponding to the associated request_context value.

   struct {
       uint8_t refund[Nrefund];
   } Refund;

   The Origin sends the refund back to the client encoded as the above
   Refund struct.

9.3.  New Credential from Refund

   Unlike [ARC], clients must construct a new credential instance based
   on the Refund response.  To do so, clients invoke the
   ConstructRefundToken function from Section 3.3.4 of [ACT] as follows:

   credential = ConstructRefundToken(pkI, spend_proof, refund, state)

   The client then uses this new credential instance for subsequent
   spend operations.

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Privacy Properties

   Privacy considerations for tokens based on deployment details, such
   as issuer configuration and issuer selection, are discussed in
   Section 6.1 of [ARCHITECTURE].  Note that ACT requires a joint Origin
   and Issuer configuration (where the Issuer and Origin are operated by
   the same entity) given that tokens produced from credentials are not
   publicly verifiable.

   ACT credentials offer Origin-Client unlinkability, Issuer-Client
   unlinkability, and redemption context unlinkability, as described in
   Section 3.3 of [ARCHITECTURE].  The cryptographic security properties
   of the underlying ACT protocol, including unforgeability and
   unlinkability guarantees, are analyzed in [ACT].

10.2.  Double-Spend Prevention

   Section 2.2.2 of [AUTHSCHEME] specifies double spending requirements
   that Origin SHOULD follow.

   For ACT, the double-spend prevention mechanism relies on Origins
   maintaining state to track nullifiers.  As described in Section 9.2,
   Origins SHOULD check that a nullifier has not been previously seen
   before accepting a spend proof.  This check is critical for
   preventing credential reuse attacks.

   The nullifier space is large (32 bytes), making random collisions
   computationally unlikely.  However, Origins SHOULD ensure that their
   nullifier storage is persistent and survives server restarts.  If an
   Origin loses nullifier state (e.g., due to data loss or cache
   eviction), it becomes vulnerable to replay attacks where an attacker
   can resubmit previously spent credentials during the credential
   validity period.

   Origins MAY scope nullifier storage by request_context to improve
   lookup performance and enable efficient storage management.  Since
   nullifiers are only meaningful within the context of a specific
   credential binding (determined by issuer_name, origin_info,
   credential_context, and issuer_key_id), Origins can partition
   nullifier storage accordingly.

   When an Origin implements a timeout for refund state (as described in
   Section 5.5), it MAY also expire the corresponding nullifier after
   the same timeout period, provided that no future spend attempts with
   that nullifier are possible.

10.3.  Concurrency Control and Credential Sharing

   The state machine described in Section 5 enforces that each
   credential instance can only be spent once.  This prevents multiple
   parties from using the same credential concurrently, which is
   critical for preventing credential sharing attacks.

   If an attacker copies a credential and attempts to use it from
   multiple locations simultaneously, only the first spend operation to
   reach the Origin will succeed.  The Origin's nullifier check will
   reject all subsequent spends with the same credential as double-spend
   attempts.  This property holds even if the spend operations occur in
   parallel from different network locations.

   Clients MUST implement the state machine correctly and transition
   credentials to the Spent state immediately upon calling ProveSpend.
   A client implementation that allows multiple concurrent ProveSpend
   calls on the same credential would enable double-spend attempts and
   violate ACT's privacy guarantees by revealing that the same
   credential is being used multiple times.

10.4.  Issuer Key Identification

   As described in Section 8, the TokenRequest includes only a truncated
   issuer_key_id (the least significant byte) to prevent Issuers from
   using the key identifier as a client tracking mechanism.

   Issuers MUST prevent truncated key ID collisions among simultaneously
   active keys.  This can be accomplished by generating keys until the
   truncated key ID does not collide with any existing active key's
   truncated ID.  With a 1-byte (256 value) truncated key space, this is
   straightforward for reasonable numbers of concurrent keys.

   Additionally, Issuers SHOULD limit the total number of simultaneously
   active keys for privacy reasons, as a large number of active keys can
   enable partitioning attacks.

10.5.  Dynamic Revocation and Origin Control

   ACT's design allows Origins to terminate credential chains by
   declining to issue refunds.  While this enables the dynamic
   revocation property described in Section 2, it also gives Origins
   significant control over client access.

   Clients have no cryptographic recourse if an Origin refuses to
   provide refunds after accepting valid spend proofs.  This is an
   intentional design property that enables Origins to enforce access
   policies and shed abusive traffic, but it does mean that clients must
   trust Origins to behave correctly within the protocol.

   Clients MAY implement reputation systems or other mechanisms to track
   Origin behavior and avoid Origins that consistently fail to provide
   refunds.  However, such mechanisms are outside the scope of this
   specification.
